# Monthly Active Contacts FAQs

### What makes a contact active?

A contact is considered active when their message is received in the workspace, processed by the routing system, and responded to by an agent.

### How do we count contacts if the customer started  a subscription plan in the middle of the month?

The billing period starts counting the moment you upgrade to a plan—and resets the counter to zero when a new month begins. For example, if you upgrade to a PRO plan on Jan 18,  you can interact with up to 15,000 contacts between Jan 18th to Jan 31st. On February 1st, the counter is reset, and you can interact with up to 15,000 Monthly Active Contacts until March 1st.

### Do MAC rules affect how many contacts I can add to my customer database?

No. You can create as many contacts as you like without any extra charge. Subscription plans only affect the number of contacts you interact with, i.e., how many contacts are “active.”

### Is there a limit on how often I interact with a contact?

There is no limit on the number of interactions with contacts. If you are on the Starter plan with 100 active contacts, then you can send and receive as many messages as you like to those 100 contacts without being charged for MAC packs.

### Does the Starter Plan support MAC packs?

If you are still exploring Rocket.Chat and are on the [Starter plan](../../readme/our-plans.md#starter-plan), then you are limited to 100 Monthly Active Contacts. To interact with over 100 contacts, upgrade to the [Pro ](../../readme/our-plans.md)or [Enterprise ](../../readme/our-plans.md#enterprise-plan)plan and purchase MAC packs that suit your needs.

### What happens to unused Contact Add-ons?

Any Monthly Active Contacts that haven't been used by the end of the billing period will expire.

### How does trial period work?

The trial period provides a trial of the next plan on your workspace. If you're on the starter plan and enter the trial period, a 30-day PRO trial license is provisioned. Now, you can interact with as many as 15,000 contacts for 30 days, which is the Pro plan's MAC scale limit. If you are on the PRO plan and enter the trial period, a 30-day Enterprise trial license is provisioned to your workspace.
