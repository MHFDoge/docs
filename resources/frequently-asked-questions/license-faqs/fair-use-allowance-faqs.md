# Fair use allowance FAQs

In recognition of the dynamic nature of organizations and their evolving communication requirements, Rocket.Chat acknowledges that there may be occasions where your organization's user count surpasses the license seat capacity outlined in your existing plan. To support these periods of growth and maintain continuous service, Rocket.Chat can provide a fair allowance under specific circumstances.
