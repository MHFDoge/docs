# Fair License

In recognition of the dynamic nature of organizations and their evolving communication requirements, Rocket.Chat acknowledges that there may be occasions where your organization's user count surpasses the license seat capacity outlined in your existing plan. To support these periods of growth and maintain continuous service, Rocket.Chat can provide a fair allowance under specific circumstances.

**Q1: What is the Fair License offered by Rocket.Chat?**\
**A1:** The **Fair License** is a temporary flexibility provided by Rocket.Chat. It allows customers to accommodate additional users beyond their licensed seat limit without disrupting the service. This means if your workspace is granted this benefit, your Rocket.Chat service will continue to function smoothly, even if your user count exceeds the specified limit.

**Q2: How does the Fair License work?**\
**A2:** The process is straightforward:

* **Notification:** When your organization reaches its user limit, all administrators will receive an automatic notification through a banner and the Workspace info page.

**A4:** Yes, Rocket.Chat reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Fair License benefit at any time, without prior notice.

**Q5: What should organizations do to prepare for potential changes in the Fair License policy?**\
