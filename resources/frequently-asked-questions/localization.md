# Localization

At Rocket.Chat, we believe in the power of communication and understand that it's most effective when done in one's native language. This is why we've made a significant commitment to localization, striving to make our platform accessible and user-friendly for people all around the globe.

Our localization efforts are a testament to the strength and diversity of our community. We don't have official languages; instead, we rely on the dedication and expertise of our volunteers and partners who contribute to the translation of the platform into various languages. This collaborative effort helps us break down language barriers and ensures that Rocket.Chat is a truly global platform.

To provide clarity and structure to our localization efforts, we've established a tier system. This system categorizes languages based on the completeness of their translations:

* **Tier 1** represents high-quality translations with 80% or more completeness. These languages are often enhanced by professional translation services and are maintained by a dedicated group of volunteers and partners.
* **Tier 2** includes languages with moderate completeness between 50% and 79%. These translations are primarily maintained by volunteers and may have some inconsistencies or missing translations in less common areas of the platform.
* **Tier 3** comprises languages with less than 50% completeness. These basic translations are maintained by volunteers and may have significant gaps. Users may encounter many areas of the platform that are still in the original language.\
