<summary>How do I lock registration on Rocket.Chat</summary>



1. **Log in to Rocket.Cha**t with an account that has administrative privileges.
2. Click on the three **horizontal lines icon** in the top left corner of the chat window, which will bring up a dropdown menu.
3. Click on **Workspace > Settings > Accounts**
4. On the Accounts menu scroll down to the **Registration** section.&#x20;
5. You see an option labeled **Registration Form**. By default, it's likely set to "**Public**". Click on it and change it to "**Disabled**", depending on your preference.&#x20;
6. **Save** the changes.

By changing the registration method to **Disabled**, no new registrations will be accepted at all.

Keep in mind that this will only prevent new user registrations. Existing users can still use the platform as they have been.
