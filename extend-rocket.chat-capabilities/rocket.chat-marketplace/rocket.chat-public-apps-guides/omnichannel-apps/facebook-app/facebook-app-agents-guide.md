If you set up Facebook app integration and a user sends you a message on your Facebook business page,

* It appears in your Rocket.Chat workspace, just like any other Omnichannel conversation available for an [agent ](../../../../../use-rocket.chat/omnichannel/agents.md)to take it.
* You can respond to the customer from your workspace, and they receive the response on Facebook.&#x20;
* You can also send and receive files during the conversation.
