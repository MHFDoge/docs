# Using Mod Assist App

### Getting started with the app

1. Once you have installed and configured the app, it will start screening the chosen channels for moderating the content based on the rules you have defined.&#x20;
2. If an inappropriate message is detected, the following actions will be performed:&#x20;
   1. The app will show a warning message to the user, and this message will be visible only to the user.&#x20;
   2. The message will automatically get reported and you can find this under the **Admin Panel** > **Moderation**.&#x20;
   3. The details of the reported message such as the sender, the channel, the date, and so on, will be displayed under the **Moderation Reports** automatically.&#x20;
3. The administrator and the moderator can take appropriate actions from the **Moderation Dashboard**. For more details on the supported actions, please refer to our [documentation on Moderation](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/moderation-dashboard).&#x20;

**Note:** The messages will only be reported automatically; they will have to be moderated manually by the administrator. The app's primary function is to detect and notify users about content that is inappropriate. Additionally, it relieves administrators and moderators from the monotonous task of manually browsing through countless messages on a daily basis.
