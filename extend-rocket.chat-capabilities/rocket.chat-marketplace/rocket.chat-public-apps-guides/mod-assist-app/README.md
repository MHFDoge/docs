# Mod Assist App

### Significance of the Mod Assist app

Content moderation is an essential aspect of ensuring the safety and integrity of collaboration tools. Its main objective is to maintain a secure, inclusive, and respectful environment for all users while safeguarding against spam, hate speech, bullying, and other inappropriate or harmful content.

There are multiple reasons why content moderation is crucial. Businesses have a moral obligation to protect their users from inappropriate content, preserve their brand reputation as a secure space, and adhere to relevant regulations that mandate the removal of illegal and offensive messages.

Given the vast number of conversations that occur in workspaces, keeping up with content moderation is a daunting task. Furthermore, the potential risks associated with exposing human moderators to harmful content have made manual moderation less and less desirable.

The growing number of users necessitates the implementation of an automated moderation system to effectively address these concerns. This is where our Mod Assist app becomes relevant. **It automates the cumbersome process of manually reviewing each and every message.**

Refer to the steps below to install the Mod Assist app in your workspace as an administrator:

{% content-ref url="install-mod-assist-app.md" %}
[install-mod-assist-app.md](install-mod-assist-app.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The Mod Assist app is supported for all our commercial plans.&#x20;

Through its capabilities, the app creates a secure and non-offensive digital space for users by:

* automatically detecting detrimental content based on the moderation rules defined for each workspace.&#x20;
* automatically reporting the messages and flagging them as inappropriate, so the moderator can then decide on the further course of action after careful review.&#x20;
* enriching the reported messages with additional information such as the sender details, the room in which the message was sent, the date and timestamp of when it was reported, along with a link to access the message directly for better context.
