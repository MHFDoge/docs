### Getting Started with ChatGPT&#x20;

Send a direct message to _@chatgpt.bot_' to query ChatGPT. Each query response is contained within a thread, allowing you to administer multiple threaded conversations simultaneously with ChatGPT. You can also send queries to ChatGPT in direct message rooms with other users, thereby unlocking additional communication and verification opportunities.

Once the administrator has enabled the app in the workspace, click on the **Create menu** > **Direct Messages** > search for **ChatGPT bot**. You can create a chat with the ChatGPT bot and start engaging with the app.

In addition to this, you can invite additional users to the conversation with the ChatGPT app. You can now have a group of users use ChatGPT to assist and clarify important topics.

### ChatGPT Prompt Examples

Customizing ChatGPT's prompts increases the efficacy of the chatbot's responses. The key to mastering ChatGPT and achieving desirable results is selecting the appropriate prompts. One important factor to consider is how you interact with it. You may need to employ more nuanced instructions in order to achieve their intended results when simple commands are insufficient. Using specific prompts allows you to navigate the chatbot more efficiently and obtain more personalized responses, thereby maximizing ChatGPT's potential.
