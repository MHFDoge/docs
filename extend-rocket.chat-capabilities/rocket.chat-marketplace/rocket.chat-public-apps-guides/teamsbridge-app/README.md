# Microsoft Teams Bridge

Microsoft Teams Bridge is an app that connects collaborators across Rocket.Chat and Microsoft Teams. It acts as a bridge between **Teams** and **Rocket.Chat** to enable cross-platform messaging among users in an organization. This way, users can send and receive messages from their workspace or Teams account.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It supports other message formats, such as emojis, files, and links. Furthermore, operations like editing or deleting a message are also supported.

## Setup Microsoft Teams Bridge

As an administrator, ensure you have access to the Rocket.Chat admin account and Teams admin account for your organization before installing.

To install **Microsoft Teams Bridge**,

* Go to **Administration > Apps > Marketplace.**
* Search for the **Microsoft Teams Bridge** app.
* Click **Install.** Confirm that the app is enabled.
* On the **Microsoft Teams Bridge** **App Info** screen, navigate to **Details > API and** copy the  `GET auth endpoint URL`.

{% hint style="info" %}
If it's a localhost URL, exposing the localhost port to the internet requires a tunnel service like Ngrok.
