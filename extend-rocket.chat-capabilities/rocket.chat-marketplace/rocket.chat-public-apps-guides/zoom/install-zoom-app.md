**Note:** You cannot participate in two or more meetings simultaneously. The generated token will be utilized for creating Zoom meetings in which the administrator serves as the meeting host. Since each user in the workspace will have the ability to create Zoom meetings on behalf of the administrator, the administrator cannot simultaneously host more than one meeting.
