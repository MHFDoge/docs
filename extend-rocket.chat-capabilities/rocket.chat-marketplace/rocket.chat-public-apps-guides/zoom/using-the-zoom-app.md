# Using the Zoom App

To use the Zoom app in a [room](../../../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/rooms.md),

* Run the slash command `/zoom start` to generate a new Zoom meeting link. It generates a Zoom meeting link, and anyone in that room can click the link to join the meeting.

Please ensure that each non-admin workspace user has registered individually on the Zoom app marketplace account.&#x20;
