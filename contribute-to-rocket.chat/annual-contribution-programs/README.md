# Annual Contribution Programs

Welcome to Rocket.Chat contribution programs!

Whether you're a developer, designer, writer, or just someone who is passionate about open source, Rocket.Chat takes part in annual contribution programs and we welcome your contributions to our project.

Rocket.Chat is an open-source team chat and collaboration platform that has grown rapidly in popularity, thanks to our community of contributors who have helped us develop new features, fix bugs, and improve the user experience.

The annual contribution programs give you an opportunity to get involved with the Rocket.Chat ecosystem and Rocket.Chat projects. These programs include:

* ****[**Google Summer of Code (GSoC)**](google-summer-of-code/): An annual program that provides university students with an opportunity to work on open-source projects over the summer.
* ****[**Google Season of**](google-season-of-docs/) **** [ **Docs (GSoD)**](google-season-of-docs/): An annual program that provides technical writers with an opportunity to work on open-source projects and improve their documentation and gain experience.

Each program has its own unique requirements and benefits, but all of them offer a chance to learn new skills, work with experienced mentors, and make a meaningful contribution to the open-source world.

We believe that open source is about collaboration and community, and we're excited to have you join us.
