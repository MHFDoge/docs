# Annual Contribution Programs



Rocket.Chat is a thriving open-source team chat and collaboration platform. We owe our success to the dedicated community of contributors who have assisted us in enhancing the user experience, resolving bugs, and introducing innovative features.

Rocket.Chat participates in the annual contribution program and welcomes your contributions to our project through these programs. We invite individuals from various backgrounds, including developers, designers, writers, and open-source enthusiasts, to participate in our annual contribution programs. Our annual contribution programs offer you a chance to engage with the Rocket.Chat ecosystem and its projects.&#x20;
