# Voice Channel Admin Guide

As a workspace administrator, you can set up and manage voice channel on your workspace. This guide explains various voice channel components and settings on the adminâ€™s console.

**To set up a voice channel, you have two paths:**

1. [**Configure without previously having a PBX server**](configure-without-previously-having-a-pbx-server/)
2. [**Configure with an active PBX server**](configure-with-an-active-pbx-server/)

{% content-ref url="configure-without-previously-having-a-pbx-server/" %}
[configure-without-previously-having-a-pbx-server](configure-without-previously-having-a-pbx-server/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="configure-with-an-active-pbx-server/" %}
[configure-with-an-active-pbx-server](configure-with-an-active-pbx-server/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
