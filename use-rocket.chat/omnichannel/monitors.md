Monitors in Omnichannel are users that have the ability to monitor Omnichannel activities and have access to [Current Chats](current-chats.md), [Analytics](analytics.md), [Real-time Monitoring](real-time-monitoring.md), [Agents](agents.md), [Departments](departments.md), [Business Hours](business-hours.md) and [Canned Responses](canned-responses/).
