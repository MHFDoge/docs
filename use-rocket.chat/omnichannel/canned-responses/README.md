Canned responses, also known as predefined responses or templated responses, are pre-written messages that can be quickly used to respond to common questions, issues, or inquiries in Omnichannel conversations or general messaging within your Rocket.Chat workspace. To use a canned response, type  the shortcut (preceded with `!`) in the message  box.
