**Reports** is a powerful solution designed for workspace administrators, managers, and supervisors to efficiently track and evaluate customer service support metrics across different categories and specified time ranges. It provides a comprehensive insight into conversation metrics and agents' performance in your workspace. You can use filters to select time ranges like **Today**, **This Week**, **Last 15 days**, **This Month,** **Last 6 Months,** and **Last year**. You can also export the data to a **CSV** file.

By selecting specific time ranges on the Reports dashboard, you can easily identify patterns and trends that were previously difficult to discern among random data points.
