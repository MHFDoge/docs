# Federation Dashboard



{% hint style="warning" %}
The **Federation Dashboard** menu is displayed only when [Federation](info.md#federation-info) is enabled in the workspace.
{% endhint %}

With the Rocket.Chat [Federation Setup](settings/federation/), you can configure your server to communicate seamlessly with other servers.

To access the dashboard, go to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Federation Dashboard.**

* **Number of events**: This shows the number of federated events that have been triggered.
* **Number of federated users**: This shows the number of federated users your server has made access to.
* **Number of federated servers**: The number of federated servers your workspace has communicated with.
