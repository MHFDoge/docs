# Federation

Federation allows for an unlimited number of workspaces to communicate with each other. Federating a workspace makes it visible to other workspaces over the federated network, thus making communication with other Federation-enabled servers possible.

To access Federation on your workspace,&#x20;

* Navigate to **Administration > Workspace > Settings > Federation.**

Rocket.Chat provides Federation using the [Matrix Protocol](https://matrix.org/) and the [Rocket.Chat Federation Network](rocket.chat-federation/).

* [**Matrix Bridge**](matrix-bridge/)**:** See how to federate your Rocket.Chat workspace with the [Matrix Protocol](https://matrix.org/).
* [**Rocket.Chat Federation Network**](../../../rocket.chat-federation.md): Learn how to federate with Rocket.Chat basic federation.

{% hint style="info" %}
![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/Deprecated (1).png>) [Rocket.Chat basic federation](rocket.chat-federation/) is deprecated from version 6.0. Thus, we strongly recommend using [matrix-bridge](matrix-bridge/ "mention").
