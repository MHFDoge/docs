description: Manually update your Enterprise license

# Premium

Use this setting to update your workspace license manually. See [trials](../../../setup-and-configure/trials/ "mention") to get a trial period.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your workspace is registered and the license is provided by Rocket.Chat Cloud, you don't need to update the license here manually. Kindly refer to the official guide to [apply your workspace license](../../../setup-and-configure/license-application.md#i-have-a-self-managed-registered-workspace).
{% endhint %}

To access this menu, go to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Settings** > **Premium**.

* **Premium License**: A field to enter the license for your workspace [plan](../../../readme/our-plans.md).
* **Status**: This shows the current status of your applied license, whether it is valid or invalid.

When all your changes are done, hit the **Save changes** button to commit it.
