# Permissions

Rocket.Chat has a vast and customizable permissions system. Most actions a user can make require particular permission, so you can customize what users can do and see.

To access this menu:

Navigate to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Permissions**

{% hint style="info" %}
Permission changes are immediate and transparent. Users do not need to log out, log in, or refresh for permissions to be applied.
{% endhint %}

## Roles

A `Role` is a set of permissions that are given to users. Rocket.Chat comes with a set of default roles that can be modified.

{% hint style="info" %}
Roles are shown as little tags on the side of a username on messages.
{% endhint %}

### Scope of Roles

Roles can have different scopes. Currently, we have two scopes `Global` and `Rooms`.

**Global scope**: A role with the `Global` scope is valid for the whole server.

**Room scope**: A role with the `Room` scope gets applied to [rooms](rooms.md), where a user has to be elected to that role in that channel.

An example of `Global` scope role is the `admin` role having permissions valid for the whole server, while a `moderator` role is a `Room` scope role which has permissions valid only in a [channel](../user-guides/rooms/channels/) they were elected for.

### Creating Custom Roles

As a workspace administrator, you can create new roles with custom permissions for your workspace.

{% hint style="info" %}
As from Rocket.Chat `V6.0.x.x` the creating and editing of custom roles is an enterprise feature. ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/2021-06-10\_22-31-38 (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (2) (3) (1) (1) (1) (1) (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (4) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (41).jpg>)
{% endhint %}

To create a new role,

* Navigate to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Permissions**
* Click on **New role**
* A side panel opens, provide the details required
  * **Role**: Name of the role.
  * **Description**: Set a description of the role.
  * **Scope**: Select what [scope](permissions.md#scope-of-roles) the role is to take effect on.
* **Save**

You can now allocate [permissions](permissions.md#permissions-available) to the role by checking the checkbox corresponding to each permission beneath the role.

### Default Roles

* **admin** `(Users)` - Have access to all settings and administrator tools.
* **moderator** `(Subscriptions)` - Have moderation permissions for a channel. It has to be elected by a channel owner.
* **owner** `(Subscriptions)` - Have owner permissions for a channel. Users who create a channel become the owner of that channel. They can also elect more owners for that channel.
* **user** `(Users)` - Normal user rights. Most users receive this role when registering.
* **bot** `(Users)` - Special Role for bot users, with some permissions related to bot functionality.
* **leader** `(Subscriptions)` - it doesn't have any special permissions but is used when setting a `leader` to a channel. Leaders appear on the header of a channel.
* **anonymous** `(Users)` - unauthenticated users that access the server when the `Allow Anonymous Read` setting is activated.
* **guest** `(Users)` - anonymous users that want to write and participate in channels when the `Allow Anonymous Read` and `Allow Anonymous Write` settings are activated.
* **livechat-agent** `(Users)` - Agents of Live Chat. They can answer to Live Chat requests.
* **livechat-manager** `(Users)` - Manager of Live Chat, can manage agents and guests.
* **livechat-guest** `(Users)` - Users coming from a Live Chat channel.
