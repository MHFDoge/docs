# Rooms

Rooms provide different methods of conversations in your workspace. They allow a more structured and purpose-oriented workflow.

## Mentions

When someone mentions you with `@username`, `@all` or `@here`, a symbol or a number will appear alongside the channel name. If someone mentions `@all` or `@here` a number will show up showing the number of times the mention is specific to you.

## Auto-Translate

Auto-Translate is a powerful feature in Rocket.Chat that enhances communication and collaboration by automatically translating room messages in real time. It is valuable for global teams, multilingual communities, or organizations that need to bridge language barriers effortlessly.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The workspace administrator must configure the [Auto-Translate settings](../../workspace-administration/settings/message.md#ibh8nd40he).

To enable **Auto-Translate** in a room,&#x20;

* Click the **kebab** icon at the menu bar of the room.

All the messages you receive in the room will be automatically translated to the selected language.
