<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Premium.svg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When you log in to your workspace as an agent and [set your status to **Available**](./#omnichannel-agent-availability)**,** to handle new conversations, <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (871).png" alt="" data-size="line"> icon appears on your screen.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Queues follow the [routing algorithm](../workspace-administration/settings/omnichannel-admins-guide/queue-types-routing-algorithm.md) specified by the workspace administrator.
{% endhint %}

**As an administrator or omnichannel manager,**

Click the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (871).png>) to see all the current Omnichannel chats in the queue.

{% hint style="info" %}
As soon as you close them, they will disappear from the queue.
{% endhint %}

Sorting this data can be done by:

* **Served By**: Which Agent is serving the conversation
* **Status**: Status of the Agents to filter by
* **Department**: The department to show Queued conversations in

**As an agent,**

Click the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (871).png>) to see all the conversations you are currently serving appear.

Basically we have 2 type of queues

1. First one is a department queue - this has all the chat's which are started within a department. These chat's will only be visible to the agent's within that department - about notifications: these agent's will be the only one's who'd receive the notification of this queued chat
2. Next is Global queue - this is a group of all the chat's which are not associated with any specific department. These chat's will be visible to ALL agents; regardless of whether the agent is part of any department - here the notifications about this queued chat should be sent to all the agents
