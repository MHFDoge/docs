## OUR CLOUD HOSTING TIERS

We currently have three Cloud Hosting tiers, which are detailed below. The Standard Cloud is our basic deployment and is included for Customers who subscribe to the base Rocket.Chat Cloud-hosted licenses (including current customers who license this product previously known as “Rocket.Chat SaaS”). However, the Premium Cloud and Dedicated Private Cloud options come with additional capabilities and costs and thus must be explicitly purchased and contracted in the Rocket.Chat Ordering Document to receive the associated services.

### Standard Cloud.&#x20;

Standard Cloud is our basic deployment and is included for customers who subscribe to the base Rocket.Chat Cloud-hosted licenses. This option provides a single-tenant workspace hosted within a shared resource cluster that is partitioned dynamically based on workspace resource needs. Standard Cloud subscribers can access self-service environment management tools and limited cloud support services, as outlined in the service scope and the Hosting Comparison Table.

### Premium Cloud.

To have access to the Premium Cloud, this product must be explicitly purchased and contracted in the Rocket.Chat Order Form to receive the associated services. This option provides a single-tenant workspace with a pre-allocated capacity based on resource needs. Premium cloud subscribers can access premium cloud support services as outlined in the service scope and the Hosting Comparison Table.&#x20;

### Dedicated Private Cloud.

To have access to the Dedicated Private Cloud, this product must be explicitly purchased and contracted in the Rocket.Chat Order Form to receive the associated services. This option provides a dedicated environment hosted in a customer-selected region, including dedicated hardware, Kubernetes nodes, and MongoDB Atlas with a high-availability load balancer. Dedicated VPC subscribers have access to all cloud services provided under the Premium Hosting, and additional cloud support/services can be added on a quoted basis.

## CLOUD SUPPORT AND SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT (“SLA”)

During the Subscription Term, we provide different types of support to our Customers, including support for our Cloud Hosting and other products or licenses that may be used with the Cloud Hosting. Cloud Hosting Support includes a range of services and resources that assist Customers in using and managing their cloud resources, such as setup and configuration assistance, scheduled backups, IP isolation, and other monitoring and management capabilities.&#x20;

Please note that this policy pertains specifically to support for Cloud Hosting.

### Cloud Support.&#x20;

Rocket.Chat provides different levels of support based on the Cloud Hosting tier offered. Please refer to the Hosting Comparison Table to understand the differences between the Cloud Hosting Support available. Additionally, please be aware that the SLA for Cloud Hosting is separate and distinct from any SLA that may apply to other Rocket.Chat Services.

### Uptime Target SLA.

Any deviations the customer requests from the reference architecture will automatically void the uptime target SLA. In the event that a deviation is necessary, an alternate solution must be proposed and approved in writing to ensure that the uptime target SLA is still maintained. Please note that there is no SLA guarantee for Standard Cloud and any customer-requested deviations from the reference architecture.

### Deployment Schedule.

All Premium and Dedicated Hosting deployments must be scheduled and incorporated into the Customer’s Ordering Document to ensure operation within capacity.

## SERVICES SCOPE

### Virtual Private Network (“VPN”).

VPN access is exclusively available for Dedicated Private Cloud Hosting and is not supported in Standard or Premium Cloud Hosting.

### Microservices Architecture. &#x20;

All workspaces deployed under Premium and Dedicated Private Cloud Services are built on the microservices architecture.

### Version updates.

Our Cloud Services may receive updates from time to time, and the policy for these updates may differ depending on the type of Cloud Hosting chosen. It's important to note that some Hosting options may allow customers to reschedule updates, while others, like Standard Cloud or legacy Rocket.Chat SaaS does not permit such changes.

### Usage Limits

As stated in the Hosting Comparison Table, certain usage limits permitted in Cloud Hosting may vary depending on the contracted tier. To check your usage information, you can access the administrator control panel by following the steps provided in this [link](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/info). Exceeding these usage limits may affect the availability of the Cloud Services we provide to you.&#x20;

## DEFINITIONS

“Shared infrastructure” means a model of resource sharing where multiple users or tenants utilize the same computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking infrastructure, in a shared environment.&#x20;

“Dedicated infrastructure” means a model where computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking infrastructure, are exclusively allocated to a single customer or tenant. This approach provides increased security, performance, and flexibility for customers with high security or performance requirements, or those who need to meet specific regulatory or compliance standards. Unlike shared infrastructure, dedicated infrastructure is not shared with other customers.

“Kubernetes” means an open-source platform for automating containerized applications' deployment, scaling, and management. Kubernetes automates container deployment, scaling, and management, providing orchestration and handling tasks such as load balancing and monitoring.

“EC2 instances” means virtual machines provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for running applications in the cloud. They provide scalable computing resources that can be customized to meet specific requirements.

“MongoDB Atlas” means a cloud database service by MongoDB that manages and scales MongoDB databases.

“Service scope” refers to the specific set of services in the Rocket.Chat Cloud Services are being provided to the customer. This includes the features, functionality, and capabilities that the customer can expect to receive as part of their subscription and any limitations or restrictions that may apply.&#x20;

“Updates” mean minor changes to Rocket.Chat software that is released to fix bugs, add minor features, or improve performance. These updates are typically free and do not significantly change the version or functionality of the software. For example, updating a web browser to the latest version may include minor bug fixes and security patches.

“Upgrades” refers to the substantial changes to software that typically involve a significant overhaul of the software's functionality or architecture. Upgrades may require additional payment or subscription fees and introduce new features or capabilities. It may require additional fees or a different subscription plan.

“Virtual Private Cloud” or “VPC” means a virtual network infrastructure that enables users to create and manage a private network in the cloud, with complete control over security and access to resources.
