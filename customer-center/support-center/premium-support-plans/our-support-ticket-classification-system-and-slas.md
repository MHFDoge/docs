# Our Support Ticket Classification System and SLAs

Our ticketing system is designed to categorize and address issues based on their severity and impact on your business operations. Understanding the classification of ticket severity will help you in effectively communicate the urgency of your concerns and enable our support team to prioritize and respond accordingly.

**Ticket Severity Classification**

1.  **High Severity**: This category is reserved for the most critical issues that significantly disrupt your business operations. High Severity issues include system outages, major functional impairments, or scenarios where a large number of users are unable to access Rocket.Chat, resulting in severe performance degradation.

    **Critical Business Impact**: Situations that fall under this category are those where business operations are halted or severely hindered. Examples include, but are not limited to, data loss or corruption, system crashes, and the unavailability of critical functionalities, affecting a substantial user base.
2.  **Medium Severity**: This level addresses problems that have a considerable impact on your system usage, affecting essential functions and leading to inconsistent performance.

    **Normal Business Impact**: These issues cause partial or non-critical loss of functionality in a production environment, impacting a limited number of users. Examples encompass scenarios where certain system functions are unavailable, minor performance issues, or when a moderate number of users are impacted.
3.  **Low Severity**: This category includes issues that have a minimal impact on system functions, affect a small number of users, or pertain to minor bugs and simple queries.

    **Minimal Business Impact**: These are typically issues occurring in non-production systems or encompass questions, comments, feature requests, documentation issues, or other non-impacting concerns. An example could be general product-related queries.

**Ticket Assignment and Priority**

Tickets initiated via email are automatically designated as "Medium" priority. They are subject to the associated Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on the account information until an agent reassesses the actual severity. We strongly recommend that customers with access to paid support use the Support Portal for ticket submission to ensure accurate severity assessment and prompt response.

### **Service Level Agreement (SLA) Overview**

Our SLAs are meticulously structured, taking into consideration the ticket priority, the specific paid plan or product involved, and the status of the customer's account. It is important to note that the SLA timelines represent the window within which customers can anticipate an initial response. These should not be misconstrued as the expected resolution time. The Rocket.Chat Support team is committed to addressing and resolving your issues as swiftly and efficiently as possible.
