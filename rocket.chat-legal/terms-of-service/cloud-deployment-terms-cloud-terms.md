# Cloud Deployment Terms "Cloud Terms"

Welcome to Rocket.Chat Cloud Services! Our Cloud Hosting Terms and Conditions ("Cloud Terms") apply to all users who have opted for Rocket.Chat Cloud hosting deployments. These terms set out the specific conditions for our Cloud Services Plans, including data management, Cloud Services Plans capabilities, and the obligations of both parties.

By using our Cloud Services or associated software or services, Customer agrees to be bound by these Cloud Terms.

PLEASE NOTE THAT IT IS THE CUSTOMER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE SELECTED DEPLOYMENT OPTION IS COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND MEETS YOUR SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS.

If you have any questions or concerns about our Cloud Services or Cloud Terms, please don't hesitate to contact your sales representative or contact us at **legal@rocket.chat.**

## 1. WHAT THESE TERMS COVER

### 1.1 Cloud Services.&#x20;

At Rocket.Chat, we offer Cloud Services Plans to customers who subscribe to a Rocket.Chat software license. These Terms apply to the Cloud Services we offer to you when you purchase our software licenses on Cloud deployment, including any related Support and Additional Services. These Terms include our Policies (including our Privacy Policy), the Additional Terms, and your Order Forms.&#x20;

### 1.2 Additional Terms.&#x20;

Some Cloud Services may be subject to additional terms specific to that product, a marketplace term, or third-party terms. By accessing or using a product covered by additional terms, you also agree to those terms. For example, such terms can be related to a specific deployment add-on or capability, such as Matrix Homeserver, or infrastructure capabilities, such as MongoDB.

### 1.3 Cloud Terms Coverage.&#x20;

These Terms and Conditions govern the provision of Cloud Services and associated software or products we provide to you. Please note that Self-managed or Self-hosted licenses and/or deployments require a separate Enterprise license agreement and dedicated Order.

Furthermore, the provision of Cloud Services is contingent upon the maintenance of active Enterprise Edition Rocket.Chat licenses. In the event that the Enterprise Edition license is canceled, the Customer will become ineligible for Cloud Services. Additionally, any changes to the Enterprise Edition license may result in the repricing of Cloud Services to account for those changes, such as an increase or decrease in User licenses.

## 3. OUR CLOUD SERVICES PLANS

As we are constantly improving and refining the breadth, scope, and configuration of these Cloud Services, please note that these services are subject to change over time.&#x20;

We currently have three Cloud Services Plans, which are detailed below. The Standard Cloud is our basic deployment and is included for Customers who subscribe to the base Rocket.Chat Cloud-hosted licenses (including current customers who license this product previously known as “Rocket.Chat SaaS”). However, the Premium Cloud and Dedicated Private Cloud options come with additional capabilities and costs and thus must be explicitly purchased and contracted in the Rocket.Chat Order Form to receive the associated services.

### 3.1 Standard Cloud.&#x20;

Standard Cloud is our basic deployment and is included for customers who subscribe to the base Rocket.Chat Cloud-hosted licenses. This option provides a single-tenant workspace hosted within a shared resource cluster that is partitioned dynamically based on workspace resource needs. Standard Cloud subscribers can access self-service environment management tools and limited cloud support services, as outlined in the service scope and the Plan Comparison Table.

### 3.2 Premium Cloud.

To have access to the Premium Cloud, this product must be explicitly purchased and contracted in the Rocket.Chat Order Form to receive the associated services. This option provides a single-tenant workspace with a pre-allocated capacity based on resource needs. Premium cloud subscribers can access premium cloud support services as outlined in the service scope and the Plan Comparison Table.&#x20;

### 3.3 Dedicated Private Cloud.

To have access to the Dedicated Private Cloud, this product must be explicitly purchased and contracted in the Rocket.Chat Order Form to receive the associated services. This option provides a dedicated environment hosted in a customer-selected region, including dedicated hardware, Kubernetes nodes, and MongoDB Atlas with a high-availability load balancer. Dedicated VPC subscribers have access to all cloud services provided under the Premium Plan, and additional cloud support/services can be added on a quoted basis.

## 4. DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY

The general data protection and security conditions applicable to our Services are available in the [Terms of Service](https://docs.rocket.chat/rocket.chat-legal/terms-of-service). Specific data privacy and security terms are also in effect for the Cloud Services plans, as detailed in this Clause.

## 6. CLOUD SUPPORT AND SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT (“SLA”)

During the Subscription Term, we provide different types of support to our Customers, including support for our Cloud Services and other products or licenses that may be used with the Cloud Services. Cloud Support includes a range of services and resources that assist customers in using and managing their cloud resources, such as setup and configuration assistance, scheduled backups, IP isolation, and other monitoring and management capabilities. Please note that this section pertains specifically to support for Cloud Services.

### 6.1 Cloud Support.&#x20;

Rocket.Chat provides different levels of support based on the Cloud hosting plans offered. Please refer to the Plan Comparison Table (page 6) to understand the differences between the Cloud Support plans available. Additionally, please be aware that the SLA for the Cloud Services is separate and distinct from any SLA that may apply to software licenses or other Products. For more information about the SLA for the Cloud Services, please see Section 5.2 below.

### 6.2 Uptime Target SLA.

Any deviations the customer requests from the reference architecture will automatically void the uptime target SLA. In the event that a deviation is necessary, an alternate solution must be proposed and approved in writing in the agreement to ensure that the uptime target SLA is still maintained. Please note that there is no SLA guarantee for Standard Cloud and any customer-requested deviations from the reference architecture.

### 6.3 Recovery Time Objective and Incident Point Objective:

Rocket.Chat agrees to maintain a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and an Incident Point Objective (IPO) as specified in the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Rocket.Chat will take reasonable measures to ensure that the Cloud Services will be available to the Customer under the terms and conditions of the SLA. You acknowledge that there may be instances where the Cloud Services are unavailable due to circumstances beyond Rocket.Chat's control or Force Majeure, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, and service interruptions caused by telecommunications providers. Rocket.Chat will use commercially reasonable efforts to restore the Cloud Services as soon as reasonably practicable following any outage.

### 6.4 Deployment Schedule.

All Premium and Dedicated Hosting deployments must be scheduled and incorporated into the customer’s Order Form to ensure operation within capacity.

## 7. CLOUD SERVICES SCOPE TERMS

By agreeing to these Cloud Terms, you acknowledge the Plan Comparison Table and agree to the terms and conditions of the Cloud Services, including its scope definition and differentiation.

### 7.1 Virtual Private Network (“VPN”).

VPN access is exclusively available for Dedicated Private Cloud plans and is not supported in Standard or Premium Cloud plans.

### 7.2 Microservices Architecture. &#x20;

All workspaces deployed under Premium and Dedicated Private Cloud Services are built on the microservices architecture.

### 7.3 Version updates.

We may release new software versions for the Cloud Services, and the policy for updates and upgrades may vary depending on the type of Cloud plan selected. It is essential to highlight that specific plans may allow customers to reschedule updates, while others including Standard Cloud or legacy Rocket.Chat SaaS may not permit such changes.

Rocket.Chat​​ reserves the right to apply security patches to all workspaces operating on any Cloud Services plans without prior notice to ensure each hosted workspace's security.

Note that older versions may no longer be supported after a certain period, as outlined in our [Rocket.Chat versions](https://docs.rocket.chat/resources/get-support/enterprise-support#rocket.chat-versions) documentation. It's important that you use a supported version to receive continued support and security updates.

### 7.4 Customer Integration.

The Customer may integrate their own software, applications, or other technologies with the Cloud Services, subject to the following conditions: (a)The integration must comply with the Cloud Services' technical requirements and specifications, as outlined in the documentation provided by Rocket.Chat. (b) The Customer is solely responsible for ensuring the compatibility and functionality of their own software, applications, and other technologies with the Cloud Services. (c) Rocket.Chat is not responsible for any issues or errors arising from the Customer's integration with the Cloud Services, including but not limited to security breaches, data loss, or downtime. (d)The Customer agrees to indemnify and hold Rocket.Chat harmless against any damages, losses, or claims arising from their integration with Cloud Services. (e) Rocket.Chat reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Customer's access to the Cloud Services if their integration causes harm or disruption to the Cloud Services or other customers.

### 7.5 Availability.

Rocket.Chat will make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Cloud Services are available to the Customer with a target uptime percentage set forth in the applicable Service Level Agreement (SLA). However, Rocket.Chat does not guarantee that the Cloud Services will be uninterrupted, timely, or error-free. Factors beyond Rocket.Chat control, including but not limited to reasonable maintenance requirements, unexpected outages, and downtime caused by circumstances such as acts of God, natural disasters, and service interruptions caused by telecommunications providers, may affect the availability of Cloud Services. Rocket.Chat makes no representations or warranties regarding the uptime or availability of the Cloud Services except as set forth in the applicable SLA.

### 7.6 Hosting Provider

The Hosting Provider options available to you depend on the location and market availability. We are not obliged to maintain the same Hosting Provider during the effective Cloud Term period. However, if we decide to change the Hosting Provider, we will notify you in advance and provide reasonable assistance to migrate your data to the new Hosting Provider. Please note that any such change will not materially affect the Services we provide to you.

### 7.7 Workspace Provisioning.

The period for provisioning workspaces may vary according to the Cloud Services contracted, as in Plan Comparison Table. Provisioning may take up to three business days for the Standard Cloud and Premium Cloud options. For Dedicated Private Cloud, provisioning will be subject to quoted delivery.

For the licenses to be provisioned and delivered on time according to the contract, it is mandatory that the customer informs the URL for provisioning at the time of signing and closing the Order. Delays in the definition of URL by the Customer will be considered by Rocket.Chat as a contract in progress without adding any damage or postponement of the start date or payment thereof.

### 7.8 Usage Limits

As stated in the Plan Comparison Table, certain usage limits permitted in Cloud Services may vary depending on the contracted product. You acknowledge that you have access to your usage limits and should monitor them and that Rocket.Chat may charge additional fees when these limits are exceeded. To check your usage information, you can access the administrator control panel by following the steps provided in this [link](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/info). Additionally, some limits are defaulted for the Standard Cloud option and cannot be changed.

You also acknowledge that exceeding these usage limits may affect the availability of the Cloud Services we provide to you.&#x20;

## 8. PRICING AND ORDER CHANGES

While the Standard Cloud plan is included in the base Cloud license fees, additional fees will apply for Premium Cloud and Dedicated Private Cloud plans. These additional fees will be outlined in the relevant Order and will be due in accordance with the terms specified.  The Customer may upgrade the Cloud Service plan based upon request and will be subject to payment of additional fees as stated in the Order. However, downgrading the Cloud Service plan is not permitted during the term of this Agreement.&#x20;

## 9. TERM AND TERMINATION

These Cloud Terms are supplementary to and governed by the main Terms of Service. The term of this Cloud Terms shall commence on the Effective Date and continue until the expiration or termination of the main Terms of Service unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the Terms of Service.

## 10. DEFINITIONS

**“Shared infrastructure”** means a model of resource sharing where multiple users or tenants utilize the same computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking infrastructure, in a shared environment.&#x20;

**“Dedicated infrastructure”** means a model where computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking infrastructure, are exclusively allocated to a single customer or tenant. This approach provides increased security, performance, and flexibility for customers with high security or performance requirements or those who need to meet specific regulatory or compliance standards. Unlike shared infrastructure, dedicated infrastructure is not shared with other customers.
