<summary>Why do I see a MongoDB Deprecated warning immediately after update</summary>

This is a result of your MongoDB version not being compatible with the Rocket.Chat version the installed.

It is advisable to incrementally upgrade the version of MongoDB deployed to the supported version. See release engine compatibility [https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases)
