# Inviting Users

After creating the admin user during setup, you can [add or invite other users](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/users/) to join your workspace.

{% content-ref url="../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/users/" %}
[users](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/users/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For self-managed workplaces, [SMTP must be enabled and configured](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/email/setup.md) before emails can be sent through the workspace.
{% endhint %}
