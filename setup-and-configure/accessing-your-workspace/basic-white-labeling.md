# Basic White-labeling

Rocket.Chat is a powerful communication platform that offers a wide range of features to facilitate seamless collaboration within organizations. One of the key features it provides is the ability to white-label your workspace, allowing you to customize it to align with your organization's brand. This not only enhances the user experience but also reinforces your brand identity among your team members. However, to leverage these white-labeling capabilities, you must have [admin](../roles-in-rocket.chat.md) role privileges.
