# Basic White-labeling

You can leverage the white-labeling capabilities of Rocket.Chat and customize your workspace to suit your organization's brand. You must have the [admin](../roles-in-rocket.chat.md) role to achieve this. You can manage the UI changes in the [layout.md](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/layout.md "mention") settings of your workspace.
