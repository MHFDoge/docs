# OpenID Connect

As the digital landscape continues to evolve, Rocket.Chat remains at the forefront, providing secure and efficient authentication methods for its users.

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows clients to verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server. It also allows the client to obtain basic profile information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

Rocket.Chat's implementation of OpenID Connect is compatible with several providers, including Gluu Server 4.0, Keycloak, and Okta Identity Cloud Service. This compatibility ensures that users can authenticate with their existing OpenID provider, enhancing the flexibility and convenience of the Rocket.Chat platform.

OpenID Connect is a vital part of Rocket.Chat's comprehensive authentication system. By supporting this protocol, Rocket.Chat ensures that users can securely authenticate using their existing OpenID provider. This enhances the platform's security and improves user convenience by allowing them to use their preferred authentication method.
